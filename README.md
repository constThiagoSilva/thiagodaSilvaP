# Hey

I'm Thiago Silva, an Automation Developer from Brazil.

I'm passionate about crafting RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions using Python. My focus is on building automated workflows to streamline processes and empower strategic decision-making.

My journey into technology commenced in 2020 during my enrollment in a technical high school, where I specialized in the Systems Development course. Initially drawn to web development, I delved into mastering tools like JavaScript and React.

However, it was during my first internship that I discovered my fervor for programming. Python and RPA captured my interest, and since then, I've been committed to this field, driven by the belief that automation can significantly enhance people's lives by saving time and boosting efficiency.

Currently, I'm seeking internship opportunities to further propel my career.

- Fun fact: I have a knack for making beats.
