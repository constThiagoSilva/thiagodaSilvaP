<h1 align="left">Hey</h1>

<p align="left">My name is Thiago Silva and I'm a Automation developer from Brasil</p>
<p>I'm an enthusiast of developing RPA process automations with Python, dedicated to creating automated solutions that optimize processes and free up time for more strategic activities.</p>
<p>My journey in technology began in 2020, while still in technical high school, where I graduated from the Systems Development course. Initially, I fell in love with web development and dedicated a good part of the school period to learning tools like JavaScript and React.</p>
<p>But it was during my first internship where I found myself as a programmer. I had my first contact with Python and RPA, and since then, I have been dedicating my time to this area because I believe that with automation, it's possible to improve people's lives and well-being by saving time that RPA provides.</p> 
<p>And to perfect and put into practice all that I've learned, I'm seeking internship opportunities to further my career.</p>
